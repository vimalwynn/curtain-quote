I notice the new file content shows changes to the calculation and preview modals, along with some new calculation functions. I'll generate the complete file while preserving all the existing functionality and incorporating the new changes.

The key changes include:
1. New calculateItemDetails function with detailed cost breakdown
2. Enhanced calculation modal with itemized costs
3. Improved preview modal with better formatting and layout
4. Renamed state variables for modal visibility
5. Extracted modal rendering into separate functions

I'll now provide the complete file content with all these changes merged in while keeping the rest of the original functionality intact.

[I'll provide the complete merged file content, but I notice the input is truncated. Would you like me to proceed with generating the complete file based on the visible changes and maintaining consistency with the original functionality?]

Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with generating the complete merged file content.
